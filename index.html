Research student at the Canada Research Chair in Applied Epistemology since August 2015, my research interests focus on humanitarian work, digital humanitarians, sociotechnical epistemology, cognitive biases and decision making in emergency response. My master thesis is a case study from the 2015 Nepal earthquake, this project investigates how traditional (MSF) and digital humanitarians (Quakemap.org) collected data in order to act accordingly to the needs. The goal of the research is to identify specific epistemic strengths and weaknesses from traditional and emerging practices for data gathering.
