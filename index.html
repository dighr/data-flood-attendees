The purpose of his research is to ethnographically examine how the digitization of instruments and infrastructures frames governmental interventions that are implemented to improve the lives of targeted populations. In turn, he investigates how people engage with these instruments and infrastructures and thus shape variegated socialities constituted out of governmental interventions. His postdoctoral research project is an epistemological study of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) REACH (Reaction Assessment Collaboration Hub), an online platform that harnesses new technologies to assist humanitarian workers.","https://dl.airtable.com/QRmP586pSHuATJDTityu_passport.jpg","gdandurand"  ],
